  <h4>#100days of code</h4>
    <article> 21/05/2021
      Yesterday the course for Leeds Trinity Reboot ended,today I start the 100 days of code. 
      My goal is to complete:
      1. Codeacademy lesson
      2. One CSS battle game
      3. Editing my portolion

      <p>Codeacademy</p>
      Today I completed Loops:
      I learnt how loop allows you to go through repeated instructions.
      A loop allows you iterate until a specific condition is met. 
      You can loop through arrays with array.length which will loop through the whole list until the end of the list.
      The while condiiton loops until the condition becomes false. The while condition will not loop if at the condition is false.
      The for loop needs three sets of information: where to start, where to stop and the interation statement (i.e increase ++ or decrease -- which is reversing)

      <p>CSS battle</p>
      I completed target #1 Simple Square. Below is a screenshot
